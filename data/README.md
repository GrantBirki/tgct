# Data ðŸ“Š

This directory contains all my health data related to my journey with TGCT. This data includes the following:

- MRI scans
- X-rays
- Blood tests
- Pathology reports

If you are interested in using this data for research purposes, and have any questions, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://birki.io).

You may also reach out to me if you are looking for the raw (DICOM) files of the MRI scans. I have them stored in a separate location and can provide them upon request.
