## My Journey with Localized TGCT

I was diagnosed with a localized [Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenosynovial_giant_cell_tumor) (TGCT) in 2023. I am extremely grateful as my journey with TGCT was short lived. I was diagnosed, treated, and cured in less than year. I am sharing my story to help others who may be going through a similar experience. I hope my story can provide some comfort and guidance to those who are struggling with TGCT.

This page will contain images, medical documents, and other resources that are directly from my TGCT journey. I am including these documents under the open source [MIT license](https://github.com/GrantBirki/tgct/blob/main/LICENSE) so that others can use them, study them and learn from them.

*Let's begin...*

### About TGCT

First, let's talk about what TGCT is. From the *National Organization for Rare Disorders* (NORD):

> "Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) are a group of rare, typically non-life-threatening tumors that involve the synovium, bursae and tendon sheath. These tumors cause the affected synovium, bursae or tendon sheaths to thicken and overgrow. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous and do not spread to other areas of the body (metastasize). However, they can grow and cause damage to the surrounding tissue and structures of the affected limb. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, tenderness, warmth at the location and limitation of movement of the joint. Surgery is often the initial treatment option. However, depending on the subtype, the tumor can recur, particularly in diffuse TGCT which was previously known as pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). If untreated or if the tumor continually recurs, they can result in damage and degeneration of the affected joint and surrounding tissues or structures. Sometimes, they can cause significant disability. In rare cases, amputation is warranted."
